Hi! I am a PhD Student in the [Computational Intelligence](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) group in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by [Jakub Tomczak](https://jmtomczak.github.io/), [Max Welling (UvA)](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and [Guszti Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/).
Previously I was a research intern in  [Qualcomm AI Reserch](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research) .

The topic of my PhD is Continual learning and Deep Generative Modeling for Adaptive Systems.
I am also excited about applications of deep generative models to healthcare and science.

My PhD is funded by the [Hybrid Intelligence](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) center.

In my free time I enjoy dancing (ballet and jazz), playing the piano and running.
