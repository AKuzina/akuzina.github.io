I am a PhD Student in the [Computational Intelligence](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) group in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
I participate in [Hybrid Intelligence](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) project, supervised by Jakub Tomczak and Guszti Eiben in VU and co-supervised by Max Welling from UvA.

The main topic of my PhD is devoted to Continual Learning for Generative models. I am also interested in Generative Modelling in general and its application to medical problems.
